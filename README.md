ABOUT DATA PIPELINE
A data pipeline is a set of automated processes designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from one system to another. It ensures that raw data is cleaned, structured, and prepared for analysis or use in machine learning models.

Key Components of a Data Pipeline
Extraction:

Data is pulled from various sources, such as databases, APIs, files, or external systems.
Tools like Pandas can read data from CSVs, Excel files, SQL databases, etc.
Transformation:

This step preprocesses and transforms data to make it usable. This involves:
Handling missing data.
Scaling or normalizing numerical features.
Encoding categorical variables.
Feature engineering.
Using tools like Scikit-learn for preprocessing and feature transformation.
Loading:

The processed data is stored in a target system (e.g., a database, CSV file, or cloud storage) for further analysis or machine learning.
Python Tools Used in Data Pipelines
Pandas:

Ideal for data extraction, cleaning, and manipulation.
Provides functionality for:
Reading/writing data (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.).
Handling missing data.
Data slicing, filtering, and aggregation.
Scikit-learn:

Used for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Common utilities include:
SimpleImputer: Handles missing values.
StandardScaler: Standardizes numerical features.
OneHotEncoder: Encodes categorical features into numerical values.
Pipeline: Automates sequences of data transformations.
NumPy:

Often used for numerical computations and efficient array operations.
Supports matrix and tensor operations required during transformations.
ColumnTransformer:

A tool in Scikit-learn that applies transformations to specific columns in the dataset, making it easier to preprocess mixed types of data.
SQLAlchemy or PyODBC (optional):

Used for extracting and loading data to/from databases.
Apache Airflow or Luigi (optional for advanced pipelines):

For orchestrating complex, multi-step workflows in production pipelines.
How the Tools Work Together in a Pipeline
Pandas reads raw data from a source (e.g., a CSV file).
Scikit-learn preprocesses the data:
Missing values are imputed.
Numerical data is scaled or normalized.
Categorical data is encoded.
The final cleaned dataset is saved using Pandas.
